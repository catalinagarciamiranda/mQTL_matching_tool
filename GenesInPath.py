This script retrieves Arabidopsis gene IDs related to a list of KEGG pathways.

It reads a JSON file containing a dictionary where,
 - keys are metabolites, and
 - values are lists of KEGG pathway IDs relevant to each metabolite.
For each metabolite, it retrieves the gene IDs associated with the pathways
using the KEGG REST API.

The retrieved data is stored in another JSON file with the following structure:
{
    "metabolite1": {
        "pathway_ID1": ["gene_ID1", "gene_ID2", ...],
        "pathway_ID2": ["gene_ID3", "gene_ID4", ...],
        ...
    },
    "metabolite2": {
        ...
    },
    ...
}

Note: This script implements a retry mechanism for HTTP requests that do not
return a status code of 200.
